# Microservices testing demo

This is a project to demonstrate the usage of [TestContainers](http://testcontainers.org) testing library for the use case of microservices testing.

## Getting started
First, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

The project uses [Lombok](http://projectlombok.org), make sure that your IDE supports it. For instance, IDEA users might want to install the [Lombok Plugin](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij).

## Running the tests
The project is a simple Spring Boot application. Just run `DemoApplicationTests` as a standard JUnit test case.
